## 💊 Medical Representatives Performance Analysis

## 📌 Project Objective
Analyze and evaluate the performance of medical representatives across clusters and accounts to monitor actual sales versus set targets. The aim is to identify strong-performing clusters, low-performing products, and profitability trends.

## 📁 Dataset Overview
The dataset was structured into dimensional and fact tables and includes the following:

- Dim Year

- Dim Group

- Dim Cluster

- Dim Rep

- Fact Target

 Fields: Year, Group, Cluster, Rep, Target Amount

-  Actuals

Fields: Year, Rep, Cluster, Group, Account, Product, Product Code, Price, Quantity per Month (Jan–Dec)

## ⚙️ Tools Used
- Power BI (Data Modeling & Visualization)

- Power Query (Data Transformation)

- DAX (Custom Calculations & Measures)

## 📊 Key Visualizations
💼 Target vs Actuals by Cluster, Group, and Rep

📈 Monthly Sales Trends

📌 Top/Bottom Performing Products

🧊 Sales by Account and Product Type
